# SOLID Principles Made Easy for PHP developers

This repository contains the source code of a Youtube course, [SOLID principles made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHE7ijbEGsA). 

## How this repository is organized

The branches are named after the following pattern, `0x-a|b` where x is the ordering number. The `a` branch contains the problem, and the `b` branch contains the SOLID solution to that problem.

| Principle             | Before | after |
|-----------------------|--------|-------|
| Single responsiblilty | 01-a   | 01-b  |
| Open closed           | 02-a   | 02-b  |
| Liskov substituition  | 03-a   | 03-b  |
| Interface segregation | 04-a   | 04-b  |
| Dependency inversion  | 05-a   | 05-b  |
