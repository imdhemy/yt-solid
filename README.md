# SOLID Principles Made Easy for PHP developers

## Single Responsibility

Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

## Open Closed

Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
