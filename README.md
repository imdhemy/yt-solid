# SOLID Principles Made Easy for PHP developers

This repository contains the source code of a Youtube course, [SOLID principles made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHE7ijbEGsA). 

## How this repository is organized

The branches are named after the following pattern, `0x-a|b` where x is the ordering number. The `a` branch contains the problem, and the `b` branch contains the SOLID solution to that problem.

| Principle | Before | after |
